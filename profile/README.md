As of January 8, 2024,  Snowplow is introducing the Snowplow Limited Use License Agreement, and we will be releasing new versions of our core behavioral data pipeline technology under this license.

Our mission to empower everyone to own their first-party customer behavioral data remains the same. We value all of our users and remain dedicated to helping our community use Snowplow in the optimal capacity that fits their business goals and needs. 

We reflect on our Snowplow origins and provide more information about these changes in our blog post here → https://eu1.hubs.ly/H06QJZw0

Hi! Welcome to Snowplow, the world’s largest developer-first engine for collecting behavioral data.  

We are the leader in [Data Creation](https://snowplow.io/what-is-data-creation/?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page). Thousands of organizations of all sizes around the world generate, enhance, and model behavioral data with Snowplow to fuel [advanced analytics](https://snowplow.io/advanced-analytics/?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page), [AI/ML initiatives](https://snowplow.io/ai-ml/?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page), or [composable CDPs](https://snowplow.io/composable-cdp/?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page).

### Why Data Creation?

Have you found yourself relying on “data exhaust” — data from arbitrary tools, hard to get into your data warehouse, in inconvenient format, not fit for your use cases? The solution is to deliberately design and collect clean, structured, rich and unopinionated behavioral data using Snowplow.

### Why Snowplow?

* 🏔️ **Rock solid architecture** capable of processing billions of events per day.
* 🛠️ **Over [20 SDKs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page)** to collect data from web, mobile, server-side, and other sources.
* ✅ A unique approach based on **[schemas and validation](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-tracking-design/understanding-schemas-and-validation?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page)** ensures your data is as clean as possible.
* 🪄 **Over [15 enrichments](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/enriching-your-data/available-enrichments?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page)** to get the most out of your data.
* 🏭 Send data to **popular warehouses and streams** — Snowplow fits nicely within the [Modern Data Stack](https://snowplow.io/blog/2021/05/12/modern-data-stack/?utm_source=github&utm_content=landing-page).
